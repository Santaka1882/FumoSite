      Fumos are a line of high-quality plush character figures manufactured and
      sold by the Japanese company <a href="https://www.gift-gift.jp/">Gift</a>. Fumos exist for multiple franchises,
      but most notably the <a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Touhou_Wiki">Touhou Project</a>. Touhou Fumos are designed by
      <a href="https://royalcat.xyz/">Royalcat</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fumos are generally difficult to purchase, even in Japan, due to their
      relative scarcity. Fumos are out-of-stock as a rule, and Gift typically
      only manufactures them twice a year, when they open for limited
      pre-orders. For most restocks, Gift does not ship outside of Japan; when
      they do, the sales go through the AmiAmi store.
